                    TOVTC here, medical laboratory assistant, mathematics instructor, full stack developer. My original field of study was mental health, and I've worked in the mental health, non-profit, and healthcare sectors throughout and since my undergraduate degree. I intially got into coding during my final semester at university when I took a neuroeconomics course (think neuroscience of decision making) that required statistical analysis using R - and that was pretty fun.

                    I am newly graduated from University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp. The projects featured in this portfolio were created during this course - including this webpage you're reading now, which is a React single page application.

                    Hope you enjoy the products of this new journey of mine as much as I had fun learning it.
