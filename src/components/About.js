                    TOVTC here, full stack junior developer, instructional specialist, and mathematics instructor. My original field of study was mental health, and I've worked in the mental health, non-profit, and healthcare sectors throughout and since my undergraduate degree, working everything from social work to primary care clinics to addictions research to medical laboratory. I've also been a mathematics instructor since 2014. I initially got into coding during my final semester at university when I took a neuroeconomics course (think neuroscience of decision making) that required statistical analysis using R - and that was pretty fun.

                    After graduating University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp in 2022, I became a TA for their web development program and a junior developer at i3 Solutions Inc in healthcare technologies shortly after - something of a dream job, considering my prior work and educational backgrounds.

                    Outside of coding, teaching, and healthcare, I also have a passion for narrative and English literature and was nominated for University of Toronto's English Department Essay Prize by my professor in 2019. The essay in question was a think-piece on the interrogation of real-world accessibility in Fraction and Aja's Hawkeye (2012) (but I'm also into other nerd stuff, not just comics).
