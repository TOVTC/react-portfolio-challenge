  ## Assignment Information - React Challenge: React Portfolio
  ### User Story
  AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications</br>
  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples</br>
  SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

  ### Acceptance Criteria
  GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer</br>
  WHEN I load the portfolio</br>
  THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer</br>
  WHEN I view the header</br>
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio</br>
  WHEN I view the navigation titles</br>
  THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted</br>
  WHEN I click on a navigation title</br>
  THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted</br>
  WHEN I load the portfolio the first time</br>
  THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default</br>
  WHEN I am presented with the About Me section</br>
  THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them</br>
  WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section</br>
  THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository</br>
  WHEN I am presented with the Contact section</br>
  THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message</br>
  WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text</br>
  THEN I receive a notification that this field is required</br>
  WHEN I enter text into the email address field</br>
  THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address</br>
  WHEN I am presented with the Resume section</br>
  THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies</br>
  WHEN I view the footer</br>
  THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)</br>
